# PROJECT 3

distributed task assignment for robotic networks

# TASK 1

1)N agents

solve constraint coupled linear program problem (1) 

using Distributed Dual Subgradient alg. contained in "Distributed optimization for smart cyber-physical networks"

2) montecarlo simulation and plots to show convergence varying N and problem size

# TASK 2

N robots, N tasks scattered in a finite environment

each robot has to serve a task, each task must be served by at most one robot

travelled distance shall be minimized

ASSIGNMENT PROBLEM: bipartite assignment graph Ga={agents' node sets,tasks' node sets, edges set | edge exist iff ag.i can be assign to ts.k}

cost for ag.i to perform ts.k cik = edge's weight
